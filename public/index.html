# Write some CoffeeScript
# Press Ctrl-S (win/lin) or Cmd-S (mac) to run your code
# Audiolet is included/initialized for your convenience @audio. Here is a example:

osc = new Sine @audio, Note.fromLatin('C4').frequency()
osc.connect @audio.output

# Notes:
# 1. Don't initialize Audiolet. It's already there for you, and multiple Audiolets get messy.
# 2. You can kill all the sounds by replacing everything here with "killSound()"
# 3. Music.js is also included, and is used in the example.
